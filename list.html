    <dd>HTML documents imply a structure of nested HTML elements. These are indicated in the document by HTML tags, enclosed in angle brackets.
In the simple, general case, the extent of an element is indicated by a pair of tags: a "start tag"  and "end tag" . The text content of the element, if any, is placed between these tags.
Tags may also enclose further tag markup between the start and end, including a mixture of tags and text. This indicates further (nested) elements, as children of the parent element.</dd>
